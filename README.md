Beta Version 0.14
-fixed stuck while kill monsters active
-changed grid size to 1.5 (again) should improve performance at the cost of a few more stucks, but should get unstuck. 


Beta Version 0.13
-fixed bug with explored target finding
-improved target selection to help target portal rooms with close walls. 


Beta Version 0.12
-changed path filtering 
if you find yourself getting stuck try editing {  if angle > math.rad(40) then } to a lower number and see if that fixes it. 
 

Current Beta version 
-grid size 1
performance hit, but should prevent stuck in numerous cases.
